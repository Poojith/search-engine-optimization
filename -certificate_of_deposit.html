<title>High-Yield CD: High-Yield Certificate of Deposit at CFS</title> 
<body>
   <h1>What Is a High-Yield CD?</h1> 
 
  <p>A high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) will earn you the highest certificate of deposit rates, but usually requires a larger investment.</p> 
   
 
   <h2>What are the benefits of a CFS high-yield certificate of deposit? </h2> 
 
  <p>we also offer very attractive Certificate of Deposits, from 6 months to 5 years at best cd rates! We can do this because we donâ€™t have to pay for fancy bank buildings, or large numbers of tellers, or branch managers. So we pass on a big part of the savings to you as higher interest rates. CFS is your kind of bank!</p>
