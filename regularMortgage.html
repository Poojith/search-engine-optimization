      <h3 align="left" class="TitleColor style1">Regular conventional fixed-rate mortgage</h3>
      <section> A "fixed-rate" mortgage comes with an interest rate that won't change for the life of your home loan. A "conventional" (conforming) mortgage is a loan that conforms to established guidelines for the size of the loan and your financial situation. Conventional loans often feature lower interest rates than jumbo loans, FHA loans or VA loans. Terms of these conventional loans typically range from 10 to 30 years.

Monthly payments on a conventional fixed-rate mortgage remain the same for the life of the loan, making it an attractive option for borrowers who plan to stay in their home for several years. The alternative to the fixed-rate mortgage is the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which features lower monthly payments during the first few years. While many prefer the security of a fixed-rate loan, an ARM may be a better option - especially if you know you'll be moving within the next several years. </section>
<h3>Best Interest Rates</h3>

  <section>With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate won't change for the life of your loan, protecting you from the possibility of rising interest rates.
  <br><br>
  We offer conventional fixed-rate loans, ARMs, mortgage, FHA loans, VA loans and jumbo loans. We also offer housing loans for new construction and investment property.
 With a shorter loan term and lower interest rate, a 15- or 20-year fixed-rate mortgage can help you pay off your home faster and build equity more quickly, although your monthly payments will be higher than with a 30-year loan. The 15- and 20-year fixed-rate mortgages are especially popular for refinancing.
