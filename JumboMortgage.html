      <h3 align="left" class="TitleColor style1">Jumbo Mortgage</h3>
      <section> Jumbo mortgages are home loans that exceed conforming loan limits. A jumbo loan is one way to buy a high-priced or luxury home. If you have a lower debt-to-income ratio, a higher credit score, and a larger down payment, a jumbo loan may be right for you.

The limit on conforming loans is $424,100 in most areas of the country, but jumbo mortgages can exceed these limits. Even so, if you're considering a home in a high cost area, you may still be able to obtain a conforming fixed rate mortgage or adjustable rate mortgage for up to $636,150. FHA loans have limits up to $729,750. Contact a mortgage loan originator to learn more. 
</section>
<h3>High Purchase Limits</h3>

  <section>Jumbo mortgages can exceed the conforming loan limit, currently $424,100 in most parts of the United States.
  </section>
  <h3>Competetive Rates</h3>

  <section>Jumbo loan rates have reached historic lows in recent years, and the interest on loans up to $1 million may be tax-deductible.
  </section>
   <h3>Second Jumbo Mortgage</h3>

  <section>Many jumbo mortgage lenders may allow you to take out a second mortgage for a combined loan-to-value ratio of up to 90 percent.
  </section>

  <h4>Mortgage requirements</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial strength – When applying for a jumbo mortgage, the maximum debt-to-income ratio for jumbo for loans is 45 percent, and the required reserve amount for jumbo loan borrowers can be as high as 20 percent of the value of the loan.</li>
    <li>Mortgage down Payment – FHA home loan guidelines require a minimum down payment of 5 percent.</li>
    <li>Credit History – Conventional loans are a good choice for borrowers with excellent credit, which generally means a FICO score of 740 or higher. There are also established guidelines for income and other personal financial information.</li>
     <li>Property appraisal – The property appraisal must support the purchase price for the home and the mortgage the borrower wants.
</li>
  </ul>
  <H4>Jumbo mortgages are a good solution for borrowers who are looking to buy a higher-priced home. Compare mortgage options to learn more on your own, or contact a mortgage loan originator to find out whether a jumbo loan may be right for you.</H4>
